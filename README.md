A lightweight server for vpeak, providing TTS capabilities via RESTful API.

## Prerequisites
- **Local VOICEPEAK Installation**:
Ensure that [VOICEPEAK](https://www.ah-soft.com/voice/6nare/)  are installed locally on your machine. Refer to their official documentation for installation steps.

## Installation & Usage

```sh
go install github.com/shinshin86/vpeakserver@latest
```

After installation, run the server:

```
vpeakserver
```

**Note:**
- By default, the server starts on port `50021`.
- By default, the allowed CORS origin is `http://localhost:3000`.
- You can specify a different allowed CORS origin using the `-allowed-origin` flag. For example:
  ```sh
  # Allow access from all origins
  vpeakserver -allowed-origin="*"
  ```

## Endpoint
This repository provides a simple HTTP server for handling audio synthesis requests. It exposes two main endpoints:

1. `/audio_query`: Accepts a POST request with query parameters to return a JSON-encoded `AudioQuery`.
2. `/synthesis`: Accepts a POST request with a JSON body that generates and returns an audio file (`.wav`) synthesized using the specified text and speaker.

## Features
- **Audio Query Endpoint**:  
  Sends a POST request to `/audio_query` with `text` and `speaker` as query parameters. The server responds with a JSON object containing the specified text and speaker, allowing you to verify input before synthesis.

- **Audio Synthesis Endpoint**:  
  Sends a POST request to `/synthesis` with a JSON payload including `text`, `speaker`, and (optionally) `emotion`. If successful, the server responds with a `.wav` audio file generated by [vpeak](https://github.com/shinshin86/vpeak).

- **Emotion Control**:  
  Supports four emotions: `happy`, `fun`, `angry`, `sad`. Any other value will result in no emotion being applied.

- **CORS Support**:  
  Configurable via the `-allowed-origin` flag, allowing cross-origin requests from a specified domain (default: `http://localhost:3000`) or from any origin by setting `-allowed-origin=*`.
